[Goat Aid](/factFile?id=3), [the Tanzania-Canada Wheat Programme](/factFile?id=2), and [SAGCOT](/factFile?id=4) are all development strategies aimed at improving food security in Tanzania. While Goat Aid is a bottom-up development strategy funded by a singular NGO aiming to help small communities, the Tanzania-Canada Wheat Programme and SAGCOT are both top-down development strategies funded by many Governments and TNCs aiming to improve the food security of the country as a whole.<br>

Goat Aid improved the food security of a few rural villages in Babati, whereas the the Tanzania-Canada Wheat Programme and SAGCOT have improved the food security of the whole country by improving infrastructure and investing in domestic agriculture. I believe the Tanzania-Canada Wheat Programme has been less effective as, after Canadian aid stopped being supplied, a lot of the machinery and fertilizers used to fuel the programme were simply unaffordable and could no longer be used. I believe SAGCOT is being much more effective and will continue to be effective as it is slowly improving infrastructure across a wider area in a much more affordable way rather than expecting farms to be able to afford to repair expensive machinery.
