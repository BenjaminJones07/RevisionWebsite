The Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor Of Tanzania (SAGCOT) is a top-down development project funded by the Tanzanian Government as well as numerous TNCs (Trans-National Corperations). Its main goals are improving infrastructure for farming, improving food security, reducing rural poverty, and sustaining the environment. SAGCOT covers about a third of Tanzania and stretches from the Indian Ocean to Zambia.

### Advantages of SAGCOT include:
- Improvements in infrastructure for farming positively impact smaller communities as well
- Smaller farmers are allowed to use big commercial farms' facilities to produce more crops
- Increase in food production also means an increase in trade, improving the economy

### Disadvantages of SAGCOT include:
- Small farmers can be pushed off their land to make way for larger commercial farms
- Nomadic tribes have access to water sources restricted and can be forced off land

The area chosen for SAGCOT was chosen for a number of reasons, such as:
- Roads and railways to the country's main port of Dar-es-Salaam. 
- Access to water and electricity supplies
- Year-round warm temperatures
- Significant annual rainfall
- Major river systems
- Generally rich alluvial soils
- Large amounts of open land for farming
