Goat Aid was a bottom-up development project in Babati, Tanzania which ran from 1999 to 2006. It is organised by Farm Africa, a UK-based NGO, to improve household nutrition and boost income by giving villagers goats. It allows for better agriculture using the goats' manure and better nutrition with these improved crops and goats' milk.
