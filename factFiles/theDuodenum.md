The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine, food enters the duodenum from the stomach through the Pyloric Sphincter. The main events that occur in the duodenum are:

- Neutralisation of stomach acid through the adition of [Bile](;linkfor "bile.md")
- Addition of further digestive enzymes from the Pancreas

Food entering the duodenum comes with lots of hydrochloric acid. If this acid was not dealt with, the duodenum would suffer dangerous acidic burns. In order to neutralise the strong acid, the body uses [Bile](;linkfor "bile.md") stored in the Gall Bladder.

Once the acidity of the chyme is dealt with, it can begin to be digested further using enzymes from the Pancreas. These enzymes break down the food molecules as they travel down the small intestine until they are small enough to be absorbed in the [Ileum](;linkfor "theIleum.md").
