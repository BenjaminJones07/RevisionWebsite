The stomach has three main roles:

- To churn food, aiding digestion
- To provide an optimum environment for proteases
- To kill any ingested microbes

The stomach has two defenses from the hydrochloric acid (HCl) and enzymes that it contains which stop it from being digested and burned:

- Proteases aren't activated until after they are secreted
- A lining of mucous protecting the stomach walls

The stomach is the first major organ food enters after being ingested. To get to the stomach, food it ingested through the mouth and then travels down the oespohagus through a process called peristalsis. After traveling down the oesophagus, food enters the stomach through the Lower Oesophageal Sphincter Food leaving the stomach does so through the Pyloric Sphincter leading to the [Duodenum](;linkfor "theDuodenum.md").
