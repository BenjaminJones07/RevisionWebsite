The Tanzania-Canada Wheat Programme, which ran from 1968 to 1993, was a top-down development program funded and carried out with the help of tha Canadian Government. In that time, the Canadian Government contributed $95 million to Tanzania's wheat production industry. This money was used to:

- Offer training for farming jobs
- Buy sustainable GM seeds
- Buy chemical fertilizers

### Advantages of the Wheat Programme:
- 400 new jobs created consisting of 121 in wheat production and 150 in maintaining and using the machinery
- More domestic food production
- Improved infrastructure

### Disadvantages of the Wheat Programme:

- Most people in rural areas could not afford the wheat being produced
- Lower biodiversity due to widespread farming of wheat
- The $95 million had to be paid back
