The ileum is where the majority of the nutrients from food are absorbed into the body. As food particles travel down the ileum from the [Duodenum](;linkfor "theDuodenum.md"), enzymes break down the large particles into smaller ones. Once the particles reach a small enough size, they can be absorbed by diffusion into the Villi lining the ileum. After passing through the ileum, the remaining waste material continues to the [Large Intestine](;linkfor "largeIntestine.md").<br><br>

Villi are small extrusions composed of smaller extrusions called Microvilli which can be found lining the walls of the ileum. They exist in this configuration to maximise the surface area viable for absorption of food particles.

A villus consists of:

- Blood Capillaries for absorbing amino acids and sugars
- A Lacteal (Lymph Capillary) for absorbing fatty acids and glycerol

The ileum has many adaptations which make it very effective at absorbing nutrients:

- Thin lining to increase diffusion
- Good blood supply for absorbing amino acids and sugars
- Large surface area
- Folded inner lining to further increase surface area
