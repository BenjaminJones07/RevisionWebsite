A condensed way of remembering the equations for frequency, time period, velocity, and wave length is:

> V = λ/T

This can be expanded to the following equations for velocity and frequency:

> V = Fλ
> F = 1/T

which apply to transverse waves. A unit method can also be used to remember how the variables relate to each other:

- V = m/s
- λ = m
- T = s
- F = 1/s (Hz)

With this, the above equations become:

> m/s = m/s
> m/s = 1/s * m = m/s
> 1/s = 1/s
